Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate learner in the world of data, currently sharpening my skills in extracting insights, building predictive models, and telling stories through data. My projects ranges from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation (Tableau/Power BI) to machine learning workflows using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I thrive on solving real-world problemsâ€”whether itâ€™s cleaning messy datasets, optimizing models, or visualizing trendsâ€”and Iâ€™m always eager to explore new tools and techniques. Feel free to explore my work, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for collaborations or feedback! Letâ€™s turn data into decisions. ðŸ“Šâœ¨
